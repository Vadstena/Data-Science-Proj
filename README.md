# Data Science project
The project consists of performing only the first iteration of the KDD-process, when training a set of models over two distinct datasets, not considering any additional iteration. In particular, **data profiling**, **data preparation**, **modeling** and **evaluation** steps have to be performed for each task. There are two tasks to perform over the datasets: **classification** and **forecasting**.

Several machine learning methods and corresponding training algorithms were used, namely: Na√Øve Bayes, KNN, Decision Trees, Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Random Forests and Gradient Boosting.
